## 1. Assessment and Planning

### 1.1 Inventory and Assessment
- **Applications Inventory:**
  - CloudBees Operations Center
  - Internal Apps:
    - App1
    - App2
    - App3
  - External Apps:
    - PublicApp1
    - PublicApp2

- **Dependencies:**
  - Databases:
    - PostgreSQL (App1)
    - MySQL (App2)
  - Storage:
    - S3 buckets
    - EFS
  - External APIs:
    - Payment gateway
    - CRM API

- **Resource Usage:**
  - App1: 4 CPUs, 8 GB RAM, 100 GB storage
  - App2: 2 CPUs, 4 GB RAM, 50 GB storage

### 1.2 Network and Security
- **Networking Requirements:**
  - Document existing network setup:
    - IP ranges and subnet configurations
    - DNS settings
    - Load balancer configurations (e.g., AWS ELB/ALB)

- **Security Policies:**
  - Review current security policies:
    - IAM roles and permissions
    - Security groups and firewall rules
    - Compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)

### 1.3 Identify On-Premises Infrastructure
- **Hardware Requirements:**
  - Determine hardware specifications based on resource usage assessment.
  - Plan for future scalability by considering additional capacity.

- **Storage Solutions:**
  - Evaluate storage options such as SAN, NAS, or local storage.
  - Plan for high availability and redundancy (e.g., RAID configurations).

- **Networking Infrastructure:**
  - Design the network layout, including VLANs, routers, and firewalls.
  - Ensure the network can handle the expected load and provide necessary isolation for different applications.

### 1.4 Compatibility and Tooling
- **OpenShift Version:**
  - Ensure on-premises environment will run a compatible or the same version of OpenShift.
  - Plan for any necessary upgrades or changes in configurations.

- **CI/CD Pipelines:**
  - Review current CI/CD pipelines in CloudBees Jenkins and ensure they can be migrated.
  - Plan for migration of pipeline configurations, jobs, and plugins.

- **IAM and Access Control:**
  - Plan for an alternative to kube2IAM, such as:
    - OpenShift ServiceAccounts with role-based access control (RBAC)
    - HashiCorp Vault for secrets management
    - Integration with on-premises IAM systems (e.g., Active Directory)

## 2. Design the On-Premises Architecture

### 2.1 Cluster Design
- **Cluster Layout:**
  - Control plane nodes (masters)
  - Worker nodes
  - Infrastructure nodes (if needed)

- **High Availability:**
  - Ensure high availability for critical components:
    - Multiple control plane nodes
    - Redundant network paths
    - Backup and disaster recovery plans

- **Storage Configuration:**
  - Configure storage classes and persistent volumes.
  - Ensure storage meets performance and redundancy requirements.

### 2.2 Network Configuration
- **Networking Topology:**
  - Design network topology to support internal and external applications.
  - Include considerations for:
    - Service networking (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer)
    - Ingress controllers for external access (e.g., HAProxy, NGINX)

- **Ingress/Egress:**
  - Plan for ingress controllers and external access for public-facing applications.
  - Configure DNS and load balancers to route traffic appropriately.

### 2.3 Security
- **Identity and Access Management:**
  - Implement a secure alternative to kube2IAM.
  - Use OpenShift’s built-in RBAC to control access.
  - Integrate with existing identity providers (e.g., LDAP, OAuth).

- **Network Policies:**
  - Define network policies for internal and external applications.
  - Use OpenShift’s NetworkPolicy objects to control traffic flow between pods and services.

## 3. Migration Plan

### 3.1 Data Migration
- **Database Migration:**
  - Plan migration of databases, ensuring:
    - Data integrity
    - Minimal downtime
    - Use of database replication, dump and restore, or live migration tools.

- **File Storage:**
  - Migrate any file storage used by applications.
  - Ensure files are copied securely and maintain integrity.

### 3.2 Application Migration
- **Container Images:**
  - Rebuild or migrate container images to the on-premises registry.
  - Use tools like `skopeo` to copy images between registries.

- **Configuration Files:**
  - Update configuration files to reflect the new environment.
  - Ensure environment-specific configurations (e.g., endpoints, credentials) are correctly set.

### 3.3 CI/CD Pipeline Migration
- **Pipeline Configuration:**
  - Migrate Jenkins jobs and pipelines.
  - Update job configurations and credentials to work in the new environment.

- **Credentials and Secrets:**
  - Transfer credentials and secrets to the new environment securely.
  - Use tools like Kubernetes secrets or HashiCorp Vault for management.

## 4. Testing and Validation

### 4.1 Testing
- **Test Environments:**
  - Set up test environments on-premises to validate the migration process.
  - Ensure they mirror the production environment closely.

- **Application Testing:**
  - Conduct thorough testing of all applications and services.
  - Perform functional, performance, and security testing.

### 4.2 Performance Benchmarking
- **Benchmark Tests:**
  - Run performance benchmarks to compare with the AWS setup.
  - Use tools like Apache JMeter, Locust, or custom scripts.

- **Adjustments:**
  - Make necessary adjustments based on performance results.
  - Optimize configurations and resources as needed.

## 5. Cutover and Go-Live

### 5.1 Transition Plan
- **Phased Cutover:**
  - Plan for a phased cutover, starting with less critical applications.
  - Gradually move more critical applications to minimize risk.

- **Downtime Minimization:**
  - Schedule migration during off-peak hours.
  - Use blue-green deployments or canary releases to minimize downtime.

### 5.2 Monitoring and Support
- **Monitoring Setup:**
  - Implement monitoring tools for the on-premises cluster.
  - Use Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack, or other monitoring solutions.

- **Support Plan:**
  - Establish a support plan for post-migration issues.
  - Ensure the team is ready to handle any issues that arise.

## 6. Post-Migration Activities

### 6.1 Review and Optimization
- **Post-Migration Review:**
  - Conduct a review meeting to identify any issues or areas for improvement.
  - Gather feedback from the team and users.

- **Optimization:**
  - Optimize the on-premises environment based on initial observations.
  - Make adjustments to configurations, resources, and processes.

### 6.2 Documentation
- **Documentation:**
  - Update documentation to reflect the new setup.
  - Include architecture diagrams, configurations, and processes.
  - Provide training to the team on the new environment and processes.
