**User**:
> I have installed CloudBees Operation Center in AWS EKS, I don't know how to proceed to access the UI, should I create a service to type load balancer? or an ingress? I have already external-dns and aws-loadbalancer-controller installed.

**Assistant**:
> When deploying CloudBees Operations Center (OC) on EKS, you typically have two main approaches for exposing the UI externally:
> 
> 1. **Service of type `LoadBalancer`**  
> 2. **Ingress** (with AWS Load Balancer Controller)
> 
> Since you already have **aws-loadbalancer-controller** (ALB Controller) and **external-dns** set up, **using an Ingress** is generally the more flexible and recommended approach. Here’s an overview of both options and some recommended steps.

> 
> ## Option 1: Service of type `LoadBalancer`
> 
> If you just need a quick way to expose the UI and you are not worried about hostname routing or multiple ingresses:
> 
> 1. **Create a Service**:
>    ```yaml
>    apiVersion: v1
>    kind: Service
>    metadata:
>      name: cb-oc-lb-svc
>      annotations:
>        service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-type: "nlb" # or "alb", see notes below
>    spec:
>      type: LoadBalancer
>      ports:
>        - name: http
>          port: 80
>          targetPort: 8080
>        - name: https
>          port: 443
>          targetPort: 8443
>      selector:
>        app: cloudbees-oc
>    ```
> 2. **Allow external-dns** to manage a Route53 record** (if desired) by adding the appropriate annotations (for example, `external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname: jenkins.example.com`).
> 
> ### Pros
> - Straightforward to set up.
> - Creates a dedicated external network load balancer (NLB) or classic ELB (depending on annotations).
> 
> ### Cons
> - If you have multiple apps to expose via HTTP/HTTPS, you’ll end up with multiple load balancers (and higher costs).
> - Less fine-grained control over routing rules and TLS termination compared to ALB + Ingress.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## Option 2: Ingress with AWS Load Balancer Controller
> 
> If you want:
> - A single ALB to handle multiple hosts/paths,
> - Automatic DNS record creation,
> - and possibly TLS termination,
> 
> an **Ingress** resource managed by **aws-loadbalancer-controller** is the recommended approach. Here is a typical setup:
> 
> 1. **Install/Verify AWS Load Balancer Controller**  
>    You mentioned you already have it installed. Make sure it is running and has the correct IAM permissions.
> 
> 2. **Create (or update) your Ingress** for CloudBees OC:
>    ```yaml
>    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
>    kind: Ingress
>    metadata:
>      name: cb-oc-ingress
>      annotations:
>        kubernetes.io/ingress.class: alb
>        # Create or update these based on your environment:
>        alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/scheme: internet-facing
>        alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-type: ip
>        alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/listen-ports: '[{"HTTP":80},{"HTTPS":443}]'
>        # For external-dns:
>        external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname: oc.example.com
>    spec:
>      rules:
>        - host: oc.example.com
>          http:
>            paths:
>              - path: /
>                pathType: Prefix
>                backend:
>                  service:
>                    name: cb-oc-service
>                    port:
>                      number: 8080
>      # Optionally define TLS if you have a certificate in AWS Certificate Manager:
>      tls:
>        - hosts:
>            - oc.example.com
>          secretName: your-tls-secret  # In-cluster TLS secret
>    ```
> 3. **Point the Ingress to your Service** (e.g., `cb-oc-service`) that exposes the CloudBees OC pods.
> 
> 4. **(Optional) Use TLS / ACM Certificates**  
>    - If you want the ALB to terminate TLS, you’d set up an ACM certificate in AWS and annotate the ingress with the ARN of the cert (e.g., `alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/certificate-arn: arn:aws:...`).  
>    - Or you can terminate TLS in the cluster by referencing a Kubernetes TLS secret.
> 
> 5. **Wait for ALB creation and DNS**  
>    - The ALB Controller will create an ALB in front of your service.  
>    - external-dns will detect the `host: oc.example.com` rule and create/ manage the Route53 record pointing to the ALB hostname.
> 
> ### Pros
> - Centralized HTTP/HTTPS routing (one ALB for multiple services if needed).
> - Lower cost if you expose multiple apps/domains.
> - Easier to manage certificates (ACM), host-based routing, path-based routing.
> - Automatic DNS record creation with `external-dns`.
> 
> ### Cons
> - Requires a bit more configuration compared to a simple `LoadBalancer` service.
>

> ## Which One to Choose?
> 
> - **If you only have one or two services** to expose and prefer a simple approach, a **Service of type `LoadBalancer`** can be sufficient.
> - **If you have multiple services and want a single external endpoint** (or advanced routing, TLS with ACM, etc.), **Ingress** with the AWS Load Balancer Controller is best.  
> - Given that you already have **aws-loadbalancer-controller** and **external-dns** installed, **Ingress** is generally recommended for production environments.

> ### TL;DR
> 
> Yes, you *can* create a `Service` of type `LoadBalancer`, but **Ingress** with the AWS Load Balancer Controller is usually the better, more scalable option—especially since you already have **external-dns** in place to manage DNS records automatically.
